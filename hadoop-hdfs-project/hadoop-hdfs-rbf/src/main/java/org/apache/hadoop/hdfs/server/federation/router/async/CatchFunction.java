/**
 * The {@code CatchFunction} interface represents a function that handles exceptions
 * occurring within an asynchronous operation. It provides a mechanism to catch and
 * process exceptions to a specific type, allowing for error recovery or alternative
 * processing paths within an asynchronous workflow.
 *
 * <p>This interface is part of the asynchronous utilities provided by the Hadoop
 * Distributed File System (HDFS) Federation router. It is used in conjunction with
 * other asynchronous interfaces such as {@link AsyncRun} and
 * {@link FinallyFunction} to build complex, non-blocking operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>An implementation of this interface should define how to handle a caught
 * exception. It takes two parameters: the result of the asynchronous operation (if
 * any) and the caught exception. The function can then return a new result or modify
 * the existing result to continue the asynchronous processing.</p>
 *
 * <p>CatchFunction is used to implement the following semantics:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *    try{
 *      R res = doAsync(input);
 *    } catch(E e) {
 *      // Can use CatchFunction
 *      R result = thenApply(res, e);
 *    }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <R> the type of the result of the asynchronous operation
 * @param <E> the type of the exception to catch, extending {@link Throwable}
 * @see AsyncRun
 * @see FinallyFunction

   * <p>
