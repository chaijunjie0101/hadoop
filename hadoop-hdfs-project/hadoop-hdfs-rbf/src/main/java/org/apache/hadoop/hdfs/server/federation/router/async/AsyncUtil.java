/**
 * The AsyncUtil class provides a collection of utility methods to simplify
 * the implementation of asynchronous operations using Java's CompletableFuture.
 * It encapsulates common patterns such as applying functions, handling exceptions,
 * and executing tasks in a non-blocking manner. This class is designed to work
 * with Hadoop's asynchronous router operations in HDFS Federation.
 *
 * <p>The utility methods support a fluent-style API, allowing for the chaining of
 * asynchronous operations. For example, after an asynchronous operation completes,
 * a function can be applied to its result, and the process can continue with
 * the new result. This is particularly useful for complex workflows that require
 * multiple steps, where each step depends on the completion of the previous one.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class also provides methods to handle exceptions that may occur during a
 * synchronous operation. This ensures that error handling is integrated smoothly
 * into the workflow, allowing for robust and fault-tolerant applications.</p>
