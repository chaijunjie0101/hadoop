/**
 * The AsyncForEachRun class is part of the asynchronous operation utilities
 * within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) Federation router.
 * It provides the functionality to perform asynchronous operations on each
 * element of an Iterator, applying a given async function.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to work with other asynchronous interfaces and
 * utility classes to enable complex asynchronous workflows. It allows for
 * non-blocking execution of tasks, which can improve the performance and
 * responsiveness of HDFS operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class implements the AsyncRun interface, which means it can be used
 * in asynchronous task chains. It maintains an Iterator of elements to
 * process, an asyncDoOnce to apply to each element.</p>
 *
 * <p>The run method initiates the asynchronous operation, and the doOnce
 * method recursively applies the asyncDoOnce to each element and handles
 * the results. If the shouldBreak flag is set, the operation is completed
 * with the current result.</p>
 *
 * <p>AsyncForEachRun is used to implement the following semantics:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * for (I element : elements) {
 *     R result = asyncDoOnce(element);
 * }
 * return result;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <I> the type of the elements being iterated over
 * @param <R> the type of the final result after applying the thenApply function
 * @see AsyncRun
 * @see AsyncBiFunction

   *
   * <p>This method is an implementation of the {@link AsyncRun} interface's
