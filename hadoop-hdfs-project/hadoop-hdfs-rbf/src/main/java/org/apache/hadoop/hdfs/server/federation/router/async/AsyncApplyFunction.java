/**
 * The AsyncApplyFunction interface represents a function that
 * asynchronously accepts a value of type T and produces a result
 * of type R. This interface extends {@link ApplyFunction} and is
 * designed to be used with asynchronous computation frameworks,
 * such as Java's {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture}.
 *
 * <p>An implementation of this interface is expected to perform an
 * asynchronous operation and return a result, which is typically
 * represented as a {@code CompletableFuture<R>}. This allows for
 * non-blocking execution of tasks and is particularly useful for
 * I/O operations or any operation that may take a significant amount
 * of time to complete.</p>
 *
 * <p>AsyncApplyFunction is used to implement the following semantics:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *    T res = doAsync1(input);
 *    // Can use AsyncApplyFunction
 *    R result = doAsync2(res);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the input to the function
 * @param <R> the type of the result of the function
 * @see ApplyFunction
 * @see java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture
